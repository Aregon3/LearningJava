Q poke him. Space his E. Do short trades only. If he tries to hit you with W - dodge with E.
If he tries to use ult on you, stay in a position where you could hit a wall for
an easy E stun

#Garen
Q poke him, start Dblade if you are in lower elo and try to play aggressive. Space his Q
and try to freeze or deny him proxy.

Use phase rush keystone. Don't ever E on him, QUICK TRADES ONLY. RUSH BAMI'S AS FAST
AS POSSIBLE for an easy phase rush proc. He is killable pre level 4. Space his E
and Q, also if you have to you could use E to dodge the outer edge of his Q.
